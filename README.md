# Weather Forecast App

## Project Overview

### Project Name:
Weather Forecast App

### Description:
A simple weather forecast app allows users to get current weather information by entering a city name. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure of the application.
- **styles.css:** Contains the CSS for styling the application.
- **script.js:** Contains the JavaScript for fetching and displaying weather data.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file includes a container div that holds the title, input section, and weather result section.
- The input section includes an input field for entering the city name and a button for fetching the weather data.
- The weather result section includes elements to display the city name, weather description, and temperature.

## CSS Styling

- The CSS file styles the body to center the container on the page.
- The container is styled with padding, border-radius, and a box-shadow to make it visually appealing.
- The input section and weather result section are styled to be user-friendly and responsive.
- Buttons are styled with hover effects to improve the user experience.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript file adds event listeners to handle fetching and displaying weather data.
- The `fetchWeather` function fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name entered by the user.
- The `displayWeather` function displays the fetched weather data in the weather result section.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a city name in the input field.
3. Click the "Get Weather" button or press the Enter key to fetch and display the weather data.
4. The weather information for the entered city will be displayed in the weather result section.

## Future Enhancements

- Add error handling for different error scenarios (e.g., network issues, invalid API key).
- Display more weather information (e.g., humidity, wind speed, forecast for the next few days).
- Add the ability to save favorite cities and quickly access their weather information.
- Improve the UI with more detailed weather icons and styling.
